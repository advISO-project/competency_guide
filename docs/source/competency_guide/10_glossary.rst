Glossary of ISO terms
=====================

In clinical and research settings, the language and processes used in bioinformatics often differ significantly from those in traditional wet lab environments. Wet lab terminology typically centers around physical procedures, instruments, and biological materials, whereas bioinformatics relies on computational workflows, data structures, and algorithmic logic. This divergence can lead to confusion when interpreting standards like ISO 15189, which were originally designed with laboratory diagnostics in mind. To bridge this gap, the glossary below provides definitions for common ISO 15189-related terms alongside their bioinformatics translations and example usages. Whether you're validating a pipeline or calibrating a sequencer, this resource helps clarify how foundational concepts apply across both domains.

.. dropdown:: Acceptability criteria

   Predefined specifications or limits used to determine whether a result, process, or product is considered fit for purpose. Must be documented before testing, e.g., control values must fall within a certain range, PCR efficiency must meet specified thresholds.

      Predefined quality control (QC) or performance thresholds applied to sequencing data and pipelines. Examples include minimum read quality (e.g., Phred ≥ 30), acceptable mapping/alignment rate (e.g., ≥ 90%), and validated benchmark performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for variant calling). May also cover reproducibility and runtime expectations for bioinformatics workflows.

      **Example usage:**  
      *“Acceptability criteria required that at least 90% of exome target bases achieved a minimum coverage of 20×”*

.. _clinical_accuracy:

.. dropdown:: Clinical accuracy

   Degree to which test results correctly reflect the clinical status of the patient (ISO 15197, CLSI). Clinical accuracy goes beyond analytical correctness to measure how well results correspond to actual patient condition.

   **Example usage:**  
   *“Clinical accuracy of the HIV viral load assay was confirmed by comparing measured values with patient outcomes and treatment response”*

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, clinical accuracy applies to diagnostic pipelines, ensuring that results reflect true patient status—for example, detecting a pathogen in sequencing data corresponds to an actual infection. It evaluates the clinical relevance of bioinformatics analyses beyond analytical performance metrics.

      **Example usage:**  
      *“Clinical accuracy of the TB genomics pipeline was confirmed by comparing detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequences and resistance markers with patient microbiology results, ensuring reported variants reflected true infection and drug resistance status.”*

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, clinical decision limits are predefined thresholds applied to computational results—such as variant allele frequencies, read depths, or genome assembly metrics—to guide reporting and clinical interpretation. Variants or signals below these limits are not reported because they cannot be reliably distinguished from errors or background noise.

      **Example usage:**  
      *“A clinical decision limit was applied to variant allele frequencies, where only variants present above 20% were reported, as lower-frequency variants could not be reliably distinguished from sequencing or pipeline errors.”*

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, commutability refers to whether reference datasets behave comparably to real patient samples across analysis pipelines. For example, synthetic spike-ins were assessed for commutability to ensure they accurately mimicked biological variability.

      **Example usage:**  
      *“The synthetic reference dataset lacked commutability and did not represent patient sample variability, highlighting limitations for benchmarking variant detection pipelines.”*

.. _comparability:

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, comparability refers to ensuring that results from different pipelines, datasets, or centres can be aligned and interpreted consistently. This is achieved through standardized data formats, shared reference datasets, harmonized QC metrics, and agreed cut-offs or settings for computational tools.

      **Example usage:**  
      *“Comparability of variant calling results across three sequencing centres was ensured by using shared reference datasets, harmonized QC metrics, and agreed tool settings and cut-offs”*

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**
      :class: tip

      In bioinformatics, consensus data can be a gold-standard variant set derived from multiple pipelines or jointly curated annotations, used to validate new methods or resolve ambiguous results. For example, the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) variant set serves as consensus data for benchmarking human variant-calling pipelines.

.. _controls_positivenegative:

.. dropdown:: Controls (positive/negative)

   Specimens with known characteristics used to verify that a test, assay, or procedure is performing correctly.

Controls help identify assay failures, contamination, or procedural errors.

   **Example usage:**  
   *“Positive and negative controls were included in each DNA extraction run to verify extraction efficiency and ensure the absence of contamination.”*

   .. admonition:: **💻 Bioinformatics translation**

.. _training__retraining:

.. dropdown:: Training / re-training

   Process of developing (training) or updating (re-training) knowledge, skills, and behaviours to ensure competence.
